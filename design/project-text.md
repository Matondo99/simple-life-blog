### Simple decorations

A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before.

### My name is John and living the simple life saved my life

I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.

Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

#### How I turned things around

I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.

It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.

#### Now I live the simple life

Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.

With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
